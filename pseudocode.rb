#1. We will know the problem is solved once our program can return the proper output that is dictated by specific input. Additionally, our program will close
# after it has received two consecutive "GOODBYE!"

#2.The sofware will be used in the terminal. Once the program is run, the user will be able to ask the software questions and receive less than desirable 
#responses depending on the format of the quesions asked.

#3.In this case, the most trivil possible case would be when the user does not provide any input and only hits the enter key.

#4.Write program that takes input and based on input gives specific output.
#Define variable goodbye tally, and user input and set both to zero.
#Print "THANKS FOR CONTACTING BUSTER'S CHEESE STORE!"
#While goodbye tally does not equal two, continue to receive input.
#Get user input and convert to a string.
#If user input is empty, then print "HELLO?!"
#Else if user input does not equal user input.upcase, and the last element in the string is a ?, then print "I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU"
#Else if user input equals user input.upcase, and the last element in the string is a ?, then print "NO, THIS IS NOT A PET STORE"
#Else if user input equals "GOODBYE!", and goodbye tally is less than 1, add 1 to goodbye tally and print "ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP WITH?"
#Else if user input is "GOODBYE!", and goodbye tally equals 1, then add one to the user input variable and print "THANK YOU FOR CALLING!"
